Where Pomodoro Timer is used as a way to increase the user's productivity when it comes to studying, our app will be centered around intermittent exercise, however, using the same philosophy as the Pomodoro method. Much of the Pomodoro Timer app's features will have similar applications in our own project. Providing the user with an easy-to-grasp experience that can be tailored to their needs is in the mission statement of both of the apps. Being an exercise app that focuses on the Pomodoro strategy, many features will be encouraged to not only help the user stay on task during their exercise, but to maintain a healthy schedule of using the app. Our app will include daily streaks, weekly goals, activity tracking, and the ability to share these statistics to social media.
