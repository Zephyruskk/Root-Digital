# Illo by Root-Digital  
Illo is an in-development novel Pomodoro timer developed for COS 420/520: Intro Software Engineering.  
Illo is your standard Pomodoro productivity timer, but with a focus on doing little things to maintain health, fitness, and mental wellness.  
In this repository, you will find biweekly updates -- "deliverables" -- to project artifacts, as well as actively developed code in the `Illo` folder of each branch.  
  
Illo is developed with Java via the Android API version 29 for Android version 10.0.0 (Q) and above. 
  
Root-Digital is a company by Cole Adams, Evan Mutchler, Johnny Sylvain, Riley Mills, and Zachary Scott.

The app currently has 1 window that has selectable workout sets of different varieties. When selected a timer is available with intervals of 20 minutes of productivity and 5 minutes of an activity of the chosen set, when a set ends, an alarm will sound alerting the user. The timer has the functionality to pause and resume, as well as skip productivity/exercise items.
