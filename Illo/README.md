# Illo by Root-Digital  
Illo is an in-development novel Pomodoro timer developed for COS 420/520: Intro Software Engineering.  
Illo is your standard Pomodoro productivity timer, but with a focus on doing little things to maintain health, fitness, and mental wellness.  
In this repository, you will find biweekly updates -- "deliverables" -- to project artifacts, as well as actively developed code in the `Illo` folder of each branch.  
  
Illo is developed with Java via the Android API version 29 for Android version 10.0.0 (Q) and above.
